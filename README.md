# Relative Throttle

Use Vjoy (a virtual joystick) to use a joystick like a throttle (in MechWarrior Online).

To Use:

1. Install AutoHotKey (1.1.22+), Vjoy 0.2.0.4 (higher versions don't currently function), ADHDlib, and Vjoylib (from ADHD library provided by evilC).
2. Configure which joystick axis to use for the throttle (e.g. Y-Axis).
3. Set an axis to use for "Full Stop" or "Hold" (e.g. Z-Axis).
4. Customize sensitivity.
